# Azure Function - HttpTriggerBlurBoundingBoxInImage
This Azure Function Blurs the area within the BoundingBox in a image and returns the result. 

I used this to blur faces in an image, and to save it as a new image. I used Computer Vision to detect the faces within the image and use the boundingbox measurements for blurring.
